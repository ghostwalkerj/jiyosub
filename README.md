### Hello! I'm Joe, a certified full stack DeFi developer

Technology I like to use:

<img src="images/mern.png" alt="mern" width="180"/>

My first choice for web development and DeFi apps.

**MERN** has some excellent features:

- Extensive & current libraries
- Strong support for Solidity and Web3 development
- Enables rapid prototyping
- Facilitates elegant UI design
- Complete set of testing tools and frameworks
- Good community support
- Large pool of skilled developers

**Python, Keras, Anaconda, TensorFlow**

For heavy backend lifting, I prefer the python stack.  Especially for any **AI** work, then you can add in the Anaconda suite, Keras Libraries, and TensorFlow (if doing deep neural networks).  Django is fine as a web framework, but I'd probably use React for the front end and Django as an interface to a python backend, pending circumstance.

**Hardhat, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppelin**

I am a fan of both the Hardhat and Truffle suites For the development of Smart Contracts / DApps.  Each has some advantages: Hardhat is easy to use and you can fork chains quickly; Truffle has an elegant UI and some friendly debugging tools.  I won't pick either side in this debate.

I believe in standing on the shoulders of giants.  In this case, OpenZeppelin's smart contract templates and interfaces.  Well tested and secure, so they are my go-to to start a project.

**Jenkins, Mocha, Jest, PyTest**

Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins.  The first thing I will do in a project is set up automated testing.  Testing becomes even more critical when you consider that you can't update a smart contract after deployment.  Better get it right.  Every check in to GitHub results in the entire test suite being run on the codebase.
